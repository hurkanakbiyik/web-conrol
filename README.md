`cd WebControl`

`npm install`

`npm start`

> Backend Server is running on http://localhost:3010

# web-control-client

Vue.js boilerplate

## Build Setup

`cd WebControlClient`

`npm install`

`npm start`

> Frontend Server is running on http://localhost:8080

Now you can open "http://localhost:8080" with browser.

This example works with web sockets because for user experince these actions have to be async.
